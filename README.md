This is a collection of small scripts i wrote that i need for my setup or other tasks. Dont excpect **any** of the scripts to be userfriendly at all these are for my personal use.

If u do however like a script(even tho none of them will prob be over 50 lines) feel free to add to this repo.

The repo includes these scripts:

- `gentoo_update.sh` a update script for gentoo so u can update your system in a single command
