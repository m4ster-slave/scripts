This is a collection of small scripts i wrote that i need for my setup or other tasks. Dont excpect **any** of the scripts to be userfriendly at all these are for my personal use.

If u do however like a script(even tho none of them will prob be over 50 lines) feel free to add to this repo.

The repo includes these scripts:

- `gentoo_update.sh` a update script for gentoo so u can update your system in a single command
- `bar.sh` xsetroot bar script for dwm or similar window manager
- `display_mirror.sh` mirror displays on dwm - needed this for school lol
- `burn.sh` cd burning script for cdrecord
- `ip_switching_web_req.sh` make web requests and switch to a new vpn server after each request
